# quickScripts

This repository contains some scripts that might be helpful in different scenarios like converting annotation files or any other random issues.
I hope one day they will be a part of [LazyTools](https://github.com/poush/lazytools)


| Script | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| csv_to_yolo.py | It converts your single annotation file containing annotation for multiple objects in multiple images to Yolov3 format that darknet needs.| Ready|
| opencv/install_with_cuda.sh | Install opencv with CUDA | Ready|
